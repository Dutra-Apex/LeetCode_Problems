# # Ski problem

# There is a 2D array m*n matrix that represents the top view of a ski area

# 1   2  3  4 5
# 16 17 18 19 6
# 15 24 25 20 7
# 14 23 22 21 8
# 13 12 11 10 9

# 6 1 2
# 1 4 3

# Each number represents the height of that location.
# David likes skiing, because he enjoys the time of skiing from the top to the bottom.
# But he hates the time of climbing up from the bottom to the top.
# So he always tries to find the longest path to ski in the mountain area.

# In this ski area, he can choose any location as the start point and ski to the neighbor location in a direction of up, down, left, right, if the next location is lower than the current location.

# Letâ€™s help him to find the longest path for skiing.
# Return the length of the longest path.

# return the length of longest path starting from i, j
